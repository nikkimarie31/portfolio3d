My portfolio Project in 3d
This is my portfolio project and one of the first websites i created. It is a in 3D with help from tutorials online. Even after following the tutorial 
piece by piece i had to make a few changes to get it to work. I also added an ErrorBoundary to get it to continue showing my website and just 
not showing the part that is throwing an error. I am very proud of my first website. I did leave the projects on the website that were 
shown in the tutorial until I get my own projects on there. I am trying to publish the website and will post a link to it as soon as i do. Thank 
you for visting my website.
